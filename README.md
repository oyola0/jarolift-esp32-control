# ESP32 Alexa jarolift-control

[Jarolift remote control](https://www.jarolift.de/files/jarolift/manuals/handsender/en/Jarolift_TDRC_08_16_EN.pdf) is ready to drive 2 motors for blinds. My intention is to manage (alexa and browser) and centralize all the control of electric blinds.

The service should be able to manage [jarolift electric shutters](https://www.jarolift.de/rollladenmotoren.html) from any browser within the same network.
